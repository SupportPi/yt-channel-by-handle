# Warning
As this Service Scrapes info from a Youtube Page, I'd recommend running on Separate Machine with a service like https://railway.app/ in case Google actually cares.

(They probably won't)

As it *is* against TOS to do something like this.


# How to Use

`http://localhost:PORT/?handle=@user` 

handle param accepts handles in the following formats: 

-  handle
-  "handle"
-  @handle
-  "@handle"

# Huh
Turns out an Open Source solution already exists.

Probably best to just use this, rather than breaking Google's rules yourself.
